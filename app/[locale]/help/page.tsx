From adjusting your account settings to creating your AI assistant, here&amp;amp;apos;s how to navigate and utilize the platform&amp;amp;apos;s capabilities to supercharge your AI adventures. </p>   </div> {/* Account Settings Subsection */} <div className="account-settings-section mb-8">   <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4"> Account Settings </h3>   <p className="text-md mb-4"> Your account settings are the key to a personalized GenHub experience. You can reshape your identity on the platform at the bottom left of the sidebar. Change your username to something unique, update your profile image to reflect your persona, and set your display name to be recognized by the community. Most importantly, the &amp;amp;quot;profile context&amp;amp;quot; feature allows you to share information about yourself within 1500 characters.

Set the &amp;amp;apos;temperature&amp;amp;apos; to adjust the AI&amp;amp;apos;s creativity, with zero being the most deterministic and one allowing for maximum variability. &amp;amp;apos;Context length&amp;amp;apos; defines how much previous dialogue the AI considers, impacting its response relevance. You can opt to exclude your profile context and workspace instructions for specific chats, tailoring the AI&amp;amp;apos;s responses to the current conversation only. </p>   <p className="text-md mb-4"> Lastly, choose your embeddings provider between OpenAI and local.

Each folder can be customized with a unique name, allowing you to organize your chats based on projects, topics, or other criteria that fit your workflow. </p>   <p className="text-md mb-4"> This feature is handy for managing many chats, ensuring that you can always find the conversation you need without sifting through an unorganized list.
